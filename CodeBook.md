###Code book
This Code book describes that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

To understand the significance of the study a full description can be found at:

A full description of the experiment including experiment conditions, volunteers, activities, measurement device, sensors, signal processing, measurements details and readings captured, can be found in the features_info.txt and README.txt files located in the UCI HAR Dataset at:

Note: The goal of this project is to demonstrate and detail the collection, merging, working with and cleaning of the dataset and so detail on where and how the experiment data came from will not detail in this text.

In the available datasets in the “UCI HAR Dataset” relevant data values, variables and column names were split up over several separate datasets.

The main datasets applicable to this project include the following. Note that other datasets (such as “Inertial Signals” datasets) were not required for the purpose of this project.

The x_train and y_train datasets contains the measurements for the different features:<br/>
train/X_train.txt: Training consisting of values for the ‘feature’ measurements.<br/>
  Data frame; 561 number Variables; 7352 obs. No NAs

test/X_test.txt: Test set Training consisting of values for the ‘feature’ measurements.<br/>
  Data frame; 561 number Variables; 2949 obs. No NAs
