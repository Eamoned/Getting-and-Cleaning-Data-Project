# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This repo contains the the README.md, CodeBook.md, run_analysis.R script and tidy data text file requirements for the Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Project 

This READMe file explains how the script “run_analysis.R” and code works and how the different parts of the analysis fit together. 

The Script will carry out the following:

1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This Repository will include:
run_analysis.R: Script for transforming raw data to tidy data
Code Book: Information on variables, data and transformation
tidyData.txt: Text file of tidy data set.
